Warning: 1 of 12000 (0.0%) transitions ended with a divergence.
This may indicate insufficient exploration of the posterior distribution.
Possible remedies include: 
  * Increasing adapt_delta closer to 1 (default is 0.8) 
  * Reparameterizing the model (e.g. using a non-centered parameterization)
  * Using informative or weakly informative prior distributions
